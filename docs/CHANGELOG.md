## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **`animica ai` command namespace** (pip `animica` 5.2.0): a first-class AI
  surface — `doctor` (14 readiness checks + fix hints), `setup` (writes
  `~/.animica/config.toml`), `models`, `chat` (REPL + one-shot), `serve` (an
  OpenAI-compatible gateway: `/v1/chat/completions` with streaming, `/completions`,
  `/embeddings`, `/models`, bearer auth, OpenAI error envelope), `embed`, `rag`
  (local index + grounded answers), `job` (estimate/submit/status/result/list on
  the AICF marketplace), `provider` (register/status/start), `earnings`,
  `balance` (`--watch`), and `benchmark`; plus `--no-color` and graceful
  `--json` everywhere. Base install stays light; `serve` lazily needs `animica[backend]`.
  Spending is safe by default — `ai job submit` quotes first and never spends
  without a confirmation or `--yes`, honoring an optional `max_spend_anm` cap. See
  [docs/ai.md](ai.md).
- **`animica up` component selection** — `--profile {all,miner,ai,provider}`,
  repeatable `--only`/`--without`, `--serve-port`, and a richer `--plan` table.
  Fully additive: existing `animica up` invocations are unchanged.
- **`animica mcp install <claude|cursor|vscode>`** — wires the Animica MCP server
  into a client's config (merges, never clobbers; `--print` to preview).
- New **`animica[provider]`** install extra (gateway + on-chain SDK for providers).
- Draft **L2 bundle mode** in Studio Web (behind flag).
- Optional **light client** proof checks in Explorer (feature-gated).

### Fixed (ops)
- **Stratum pool payouts**: per-payout mempool-aware nonce resolution + a unique
  per-payout fee so identical (address, amount) payouts no longer collide to the
  same tx hash and no-op on-chain (the nonce-less execution model meant repeats
  were silently dropped). Recognizes `nonce_gap` for retry.
- **Dependency pin**: `starlette<0.47` (and `sse-starlette<3` in the `mcp` extra)
  to stop a transitive upgrade from breaking every FastAPI service on restart.

### Changed
- Increased default RPC request timeout from **10s → 15s** in SDKs.
- Minor copy and accessibility improvements on website.

### Fixed
- Wallet: resilient reconnect to WS `newHeads` after system sleep.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2025-05-30 — “Useful Compute”
### Added

## Changelog Conventions

- **Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed / Security / Deprecated / Breaking / Migration** headings.
- When applicable, include **config keys** and **expected impacts**.
- Prefer **human-oriented** summaries; implementation detail belongs in PRs.
