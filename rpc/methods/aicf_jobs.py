"""
aicf.* job-submission RPC methods.

Implements the inference-job API the `distributed-aicf` provider in
ai/agent_runtime/src/agent_runtime/aicf_client.py expects to find on the
node. Methods registered:

    aicf.estimateJobCost
    aicf.submitInferenceJob
    aicf.streamJob
    aicf.jobStatus
    aicf.settleJob
    aicf.workerRegister
    aicf.workerStatus
    aicf.workerClaimNextJob
    aicf.workerSubmitResult

This is a single-process, in-memory implementation of the protocol — it
keeps the job lifecycle correct end-to-end (estimate → submit → stream →
settle) so `animica chat` works, and supports external workers registering
and claiming jobs. If no external worker claims a job within a short
grace period, a built-in local fallback completes it with a stub
response. The stub clearly identifies itself so it isn't mistaken for
real inference output.

State is reset on every node restart by design — distributed jobs are not
yet persisted to chain state. Long-term, the queue/storage and economics
modules under aicf/queue/* and aicf/economics/* will replace this; for
now they provide the helpers we use here (pricing, job id derivation).

# The pipeline path chains N worker stages to produce one chat answer.
# Each stage owns a transform (in the reference runner: identity + a
# stage marker; in a real layer-sharded miner: a contiguous layer range
# of the underlying model). Stage 0 reads the original prompt; stage k
# pulls the upstream activation from stage k-1. The final stage's
# `output_text` becomes the job's text and triggers settlement.
#
# Wire protocol summary:
#   1. Submit creates a pipeline job with N pending stages.
#   2. Workers (registered with tier=="pipeline") poll
#      aicf.pipelineClaimStage. The store hands out the lowest pending
#      stage and refuses to give the same worker a second stage of the
#      same job (would deadlock self-dependency).
#   3. Stage k worker calls aicf.pipelineGetUpstreamActivation with
#      stage_index=k. The node long-polls (~1.5s) until stage k-1 has
#      written its output, then returns it. Stage 0 gets no upstream
#      payload, just the prompt from claimStage.
#   4. Worker computes its transform on the upstream activation, then
#      calls aicf.pipelineSubmitStageResult with the new activation
#      (and `output_text` only on the final stage).

# What's intentionally NOT in scope here (and noted for the follow-up
# work that turns this into "actually faster than running on one
# worker"):
#   - Sharded model bundles. Today's bundles are monolithic; layer-range
#     loading is a separate bundle-format effort.
#   - Direct worker-to-worker activation transport. Activations are
#     currently proxied through the node, which adds a round-trip per
#     stage. Fine for kbyte hidden states; bottleneck for MB ones.
#   - Multi-party payment split. The current settlement credits the
#     final-stage worker; cross-stage revenue share is a future TODO.
#   - Mid-job stage worker replacement / partial re-execution.

#   1. Stage N-1 samples T_k from its LM-head logits, appends T_k to
#      ``job.text`` (so streamJob delivers the character to the chat
#      client), then calls aicf.pipelineFeedToken(job_id, T_k).
#   2. The node enqueues T_k in ``job.decode_inbox``.
#   3. Stage 0 long-polls aicf.pipelineGetNextTokenStep, which dequeues
#      the oldest pending token. The stage embeds it, runs its layer
#      range with the locally-cached KV state, and submits the result
#      via aicf.pipelineSubmitDecodeStep with step_index=k+1.
#   4. Middle stages long-poll aicf.pipelineGetUpstreamStep for the
#      previous stage's step k+1 output, run their layers, submit
#      their own step k+1.
#   5. Stage N-1 picks up step k+1 from its upstream and the loop
#      repeats. When the final stage decides to stop (EOS or
#      max_new_tokens) it sets meta.is_terminal=True on its submit,
#      which closes the job.
#
# All four endpoints below long-poll for ~1.5s so the chat path runs
