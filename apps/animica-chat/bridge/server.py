"""Animica Chat ↔ AICF bridge.

Exposes an OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface (/v1/chat/completions,
/v1/models) and translates each request into an on-chain AICF job
via agent_runtime.providers.DistributedAICFProvider. The chain's
existing miners serve the inference and get paid in ANM; the chat
server (animica-chat-server) calls this bridge instead of OpenAI.

Why bridge instead of using aicf-api directly:
- aicf-api on :8099 keeps its own provider registry, separate from the
  chain's AICF workers. Without a registered model node it falls back
  to a first-party stub, which is what the user sees right now.
- The 15 AICF workers already running register against the chain RPC
  (port 8545) via aicf.workerRegister. The chain queues jobs and the
  workers pick them up. DistributedAICFProvider is the canonical
  Python client for that flow; it handles wallet payment signing.

Single global provider instance is created at startup; concurrent
requests share it. The underlying AICFClient is httpx.Client-based
and threadsafe for the calls we make.
