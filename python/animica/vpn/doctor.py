"""
`animica vpn doctor` — leak self-test that GATES the 'connected' claim.

It refuses to report a healthy tunnel until the checks pass, so the CLI never tells a user
they're protected when they're leaking. Checks (best-effort, honest about what it can't verify):
  * tunnel handshake is live
  * apparent public IP changed (traffic really egresses via the exit)
  * IPv6 is tunnelled-or-blocked (no v6 leak around the v4 tunnel)
  * DNS resolves (through the tunnel resolver)
  * killswitch present for full-tunnel sessions
