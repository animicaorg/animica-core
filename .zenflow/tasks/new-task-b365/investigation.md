# Bug Investigation: Transaction Not in Mempool

## Bug Summary
Transactions submitted via `animica tx send` are accepted by the RPC (`tx.sendRawTransaction`) but do not appear in the mempool when queried via `mempool.getPending` or `mempool.explain`.

## Error Message
```
=== ERROR: Transaction Not in Mempool ===
TX hash: 0x25a87844012681bc369c4cad1acb755c796f5e0d54395c375c1ecaeccab5e0ee

The RPC accepted the transaction but it is NOT in the mempool.
Possible reasons:
  • Nonce gap (tx nonce is too high)
  • Fee too low (below minimum gas price)
  • Gas limit too high (exceeds block limit)
  • Mempool full (tx evicted)
  • Internal mempool error (transaction submitted but not persisted)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After tracing through the code, I've identified a **type mismatch** issue in the mempool service:

### The Issue

In `rpc/mempool_service.py:240-244`, the `PoolTx` is created with `tx_hash_bytes` (bytes):
```python
pool_tx = PoolTx(
    tx=tx,
    tx_hash=tx_hash_bytes,  # <-- This is bytes
    raw=raw,
    meta=meta,
    fee=fee,
)
```

However, in `mempool/types.py:284`, the type annotation for `tx_hash` indicates it should be a **string**:
```python
@dataclass(order=True)
class PoolTx:
    ...
    tx_hash: TxHash = field(compare=False)  # TxHash = str (line 52)
```

### Why This Causes the Bug

1. **Storage**: When `pool.add()` is called, it stores the transaction using the hash:
   - `pool.py:413`: `h = getattr(tx, "hash", None) or getattr(tx, "tx_hash", None)`
   - If `tx_hash` is bytes, `h` becomes bytes
   - `pool.py:442`: `self.index.add(h, tx, meta)` - stores with bytes key

2. **Lookup**: When checking if transaction is in mempool:
   - `mempool_service.py:140-144`: `has_hash()` method calls `pool.get(_normalize_hash_bytes(tx_hash_hex))`
   - `_normalize_hash_bytes()` converts the hex string to bytes
   - `pool.get()` looks up using these bytes

3. **The Problem**: If there's any inconsistency in how the hash is stored vs looked up (e.g., if PoolTx.tx_hash is sometimes treated as string vs bytes), the lookup will fail even though the transaction was added.

### Additional Observations

Looking at the verification logic in the codebase:

- **RPC Handler** (`rpc/methods/tx.py:1476-1488`): Has verification after `mempool_service.submit()`
- **Mempool Service** (`rpc/mempool_service.py:255-263`): Has verification after `pool.add()`

Both verification steps check `has_hash()`, which should catch this issue. However, the CLI's error suggests that:
1. The RPC verification passes (so transaction returns success)
2. The CLI's subsequent check fails (transaction not found in `mempool.getPending`)

This indicates a **timing issue** or an **inconsistency** between:
- How the pool stores/retrieves internally (used by verification)
- How `mempool.getPending` iterates over transactions

### Affected Components

1. `rpc/mempool_service.py` - Creates PoolTx with bytes for tx_hash
2. `mempool/types.py` - PoolTx type hints say tx_hash should be str
3. `mempool/pool.py` - Stores and retrieves using hash attribute
4. `python/animica/cli/tx.py` - CLI verification that detects the bug

## Proposed Solution

**Option 1: Normalize tx_hash to always be hex string**
- Change `mempool_service.py` to pass hex string: `tx_hash=tx_hash_hex`
- Ensure `pool.py` handles string hashes consistently
- Update `pool.get()` and related methods to expect string hashes

**Option 2: Normalize tx_hash to always be bytes**
- Update `mempool/types.py` type hint: `tx_hash: bytes`
- Ensure all lookups use bytes consistently
- Update `has_hash()` to always convert to bytes

**Option 3 (Recommended): Use consistent types with explicit conversion**
- Store as bytes internally in pool
- Convert to hex at API boundaries
- Add explicit type conversions at interface points
- Add validation/assertions to catch type mismatches early

## Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Nonce gap scenario**: Transaction with future nonce is held but not ready
   - Pool adds to index but not to ready heap
   - Should still be findable via `pool.get()` and `pool.index.all_items()`

2. **Transaction eviction**: Transaction added then immediately evicted
   - Could cause timing issue if verification happens before eviction

3. **Hash normalization**: Different hash formats (0x-prefixed, lowercase, bytes)
   - Need consistent normalization across all code paths

## Next Steps

1. Add debug logging to track hash values (type and value) through the flow
2. Write regression test that reproduces the exact scenario
3. Implement fix with proper type conversions
4. Update pool internals to be consistent about hash types
5. Add assertions to catch type mismatches early in development

## Implementation Notes

### Actual Root Cause (Updated)

After deeper investigation, the root cause was **not** a type mismatch issue, but rather a **missing synchronization** between two pending transaction tracking systems:

1. **MempoolService.pool** - The actual Pool object that stores transactions for mining
2. **Pending pool cache** (_PEND or _FALLBACK_PENDING) - A separate cache used by `mempool.getPending` RPC

**The Bug:**
- When a transaction is submitted via `tx.sendRawTransaction` with `mempool_service` available:
  - Line 1473 in `rpc/methods/tx.py`: `mempool_service.submit()` adds tx to the Pool ✅
  - BUT: `_pending_put()` is only called in the `else` branch (line 1503), when mempool_service is NOT available ❌
- When `mempool.getPending` is called:
  - Line 46-58 in `rpc/methods/mempool.py`: Tries to use `mempool_service.get_pending_snapshot()` if available
  - But `mempool_service` doesn't have this method, so it falls back to `_PEND` or `_FALLBACK_PENDING`
  - The transaction was never added to these caches, so it's not found ❌

**Flow Diagram:**
```
tx.sendRawTransaction
  ├─> mempool_service.submit() → adds to Pool ✅
  └─> _pending_put() NOT called ❌  (only called when mempool_service is None)

mempool.getPending
  ├─> tries mempool_service.get_pending_snapshot() → method doesn't exist
  └─> falls back to _PEND/_FALLBACK_PENDING → transaction not there ❌
```

### The Fix

**File:** `rpc/methods/tx.py`  
**Location:** After line 1493 (after successful mempool verification)  
**Change:** Added call to `_pending_put(tx_hash_hex, raw)` to synchronize with pending pool cache

```python
# rpc/methods/tx.py:1490-1496
log.info(
    "tx.sendRawTransaction: VERIFIED tx in mempool, hash=%s",
    tx_hash_hex,
)

# Also add to pending pool cache for mempool.getPending RPC
_pending_put(tx_hash_hex, raw)  # <-- ADDED
```

This ensures that when a transaction is successfully added to the mempool_service.pool, it's also registered in the pending pool cache that `mempool.getPending` queries.

### Test Coverage

**Existing Test:** `rpc/tests/test_tx_send_mempool_visibility.py::test_tx_send_appears_in_mempool_immediately`

This test already covers the exact bug scenario:
1. Submits a transaction via `tx.sendRawTransaction`
2. Immediately calls `mempool.getPending`
3. Verifies the transaction appears in the pending list

**Test Assertion (lines 127-130):**
```python
assert got_hash in pending_hashes, (
    f"CRITICAL BUG: tx {got_hash} was submitted successfully but NOT in mempool.getPending. "
    f"Pending hashes: {pending_hashes}"
)
```

This test would have **failed** before the fix and **passes** after the fix.

### Verification

The fix resolves the issue by ensuring that:
1. ✅ Transactions submitted via mempool_service are added to the Pool
2. ✅ Transactions are also registered in the pending pool cache
3. ✅ `mempool.getPending` can find the transaction
4. ✅ CLI verification passes without error

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Add `get_pending_snapshot()` to MempoolService** - More complex, requires refactoring
2. **Remove fallback to _PEND/_FALLBACK_PENDING** - Breaking change, would break backwards compatibility
3. **Current solution (call _pending_put)** - ✅ Minimal change, maintains compatibility, fixes the bug

### Impact

- **Files Changed:** 1 (`rpc/methods/tx.py`)
- **Lines Added:** 2 (1 comment + 1 code line)
- **Breaking Changes:** None
- **Performance Impact:** Negligible (one additional dict insertion per transaction)
