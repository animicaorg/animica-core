"""
Animica Python VM (browser subset) — vm_pkg
===========================================

This package is the **Pyodide-compatible subset** of the Animica Python VM, used by
`@animica/studio-wasm` to compile and simulate contracts entirely in the browser.

It is generated during the build by `studio-wasm/scripts/sync_vm_py.py`, which copies a
curated set of modules from the source `vm_py/` tree, rewrites imports to `vm_pkg.*`,
and writes a small manifest (`_sync_manifest.json`) including the upstream VM version.

The subset intentionally omits host-specific pieces (e.g., sandbox/syscalls/state
adapters). Contract-facing APIs (ABI, storage, events, hashing) and the interpreter,
IR encoder/decoder, and minimal typechecking/gas-estimation are included.

Do not edit files in this directory by hand; changes will be overwritten by the sync
script. Extend or patch the upstream `vm_py/` package instead.
