# height >= its activation height and is grandfathered below it, so existing
# history stays valid: forward-only, never a genesis reset, never rejects a block
# produced before the height. Mainnet heights sit a safe margin above the head at
# ship time so all nodes AND the miner upgrade first (a non-upgraded miner that
# mined a now-invalid block after the height would simply be orphaned by upgraded
# nodes). Per-fork env override: ANIMICA_FORK_<UPPER>_HEIGHT (retune before ship).
#
#   pq_hardening: at/after this height, block import verifies every transaction
#     signature (mandatory) and accepts ONLY the non-forgeable production scheme
#     ml_dsa_65 (0x1003), closing the ANM-C01/C02 forgeable-stub fund-drain. The
#     node-local mempool/relay/mining rejection of forgeable schemes is always-on
#     and independent of this height (animica.tx.signing.ACCEPTED_TX_SIG_ALG_IDS).
FORK_PQ_HARDENING = "pq_hardening"

#   root_commitment: at/after this height, block import verifies the header's
#     committed txsRoot against the block's transactions (and, once the miner seals
#     them, stateRoot/receiptsRoot), closing the ANM-C03 silent-divergence hole
#     where a PoW-valid header could carry a different tx set or an invalid state
#     transition undetected. Self-gating (only enforces a root the header commits
#     non-zero) + grandfathered below H; the post-execution stateRoot check honours
#     ANIMICA_ROOT_COMMITMENT_SHADOW=1 (observe-only) for pre-activation validation.

#   address_freeze: at/after this height, block import REJECTS any block that
#     contains a non-coinbase transaction whose authoritative sender OR recipient
#     is a consensus-frozen account (execution.migrations.address_freeze_2026).
#     This upgrades the node-local, trivially-bypassable mempool freeze
#     (mempool/address_denylist.py — a per-node env/file control that only stops
#     the operator's own nodes from ADMITTING or MINING a frozen spend) into a
#     hard, network-wide consensus rule: an upgraded node will not build on a
#     chain that moves frozen funds, so a stolen/leaked-key address cannot be
#     drained by taking the operator's node offline. The frozen set is a
#     code-committed constant (identical on every node — never env/file), so the
#     reject decision is deterministic; it writes NO state (stateRoot is only
#     shadow-enforced), so a rule-violating block is loudly orphaned rather than
#     silently forking balances. Forward-only + grandfathered below H; DAO-fork
#     shape — every block producer MUST run this build before the height or a
#     post-height frozen-spend block they mine will be orphaned by upgraded nodes.
FORK_ADDRESS_FREEZE = "address_freeze"

#   foundation_split: at/after this height, the block subsidy is split 85% miner /
#     15% foundation treasury instead of 100% miner. The base subsidy is UNCHANGED
#     (still 300 ANM/block at the current epoch, halving on the same schedule) — the
#     15% is a redistribution of the SAME total, not new issuance, so total emission
#     and the MAX_MONEY supply cap are unaffected (miner+treasury == the old miner
#     amount, every block). The 15% is credited to a code-committed foundation
#     address (consensus.rewards.FOUNDATION_TREASURY_ADDRESS — identical on every
#     node, never env/params) so the credit is deterministic and byte-identical.
#     UNLIKE address_freeze (a reject-only rule that writes no state and is loudly
#     orphaned on violation), this is a STATE-MUTATING emission change: this chain
#     commits no enforced stateRoot, so a node that does NOT run this build will keep
#     crediting 100% to the miner and silently under-credit the foundation — a
#     balance divergence, not a chain split (the same PoW-valid blocks are accepted
#     by both). There is therefore NO loud reject available; correctness depends on
#     coordinated upgrade. Every full node, the pool/miner, and every exchange or
#     explorer that tracks balances MUST run this build (or set
#     ANIMICA_FORK_FOUNDATION_SPLIT_HEIGHT) before this height, or their balances
#     diverge from the network. Forward-only + grandfathered below H (pre-H rewards
#     stay 100% miner; history is never re-credited). Activation is its OWN height,
#     one block after address_freeze, so the two rule changes are never co-located.

# FORK_STATE_COMMITMENT (7.1.9) — the deterministic "inclusion ⇒ execution" cure.
# From H, a block that commits a NON-ZERO stateRoot must commit the REAL
# post-execution root: every node re-applies the block to its parent state (the
# path _apply_block_state already runs for BOTH the tip and reorg) and REJECTS on
# mismatch. Self-gating on non-zero (a zero/uncommitted root is accepted, so a
# pre-fork or not-yet-upgraded miner's zero-root block never false-rejects — no
# split from adoption; only a WRONG non-zero root is rejected). The miner seals
# the root via BlockImporter.compute_sealed_state_root (identical apply → equal
# root by construction). Forward-only + grandfathered below H. This is state-
# VERIFYING, not state-producing, so it cannot change emission; but a determinism
# bug in compute_state_root would split, hence it enables only after a live
# shadow window with zero mismatches (ANIMICA_ROOT_COMMITMENT_SHADOW=1) and an
# adversarial review. Retunable via ANIMICA_FORK_STATE_COMMITMENT_HEIGHT.

# FORK_TREASURY_25 (9.4.0) — the foundation-treasury share of the per-block subsidy
# goes from 15% to 25%. Operator decision, activation height 70,000.
#
# This changes only the DIVISION of the subsidy, never its total: miner + treasury
# still equals the pre-split subsidy every block, the halving schedule is untouched
# and MAX_MONEY is unaffected — exactly like FORK_FOUNDATION_SPLIT before it. The
# percentage is a code-committed constant read through a height-gated helper (see
# consensus/rewards.foundation_split_pct) so emission is byte-identical on every
# node; it is never taken from params, env or wallclock at validation time.
#
# WHY IT IS SAFE TO GATE THIS WAY: every input is the block height, so two honest
# nodes on the same chain always compute the same split. Forward-only and
# grandfathered — blocks below H keep 85/15 forever and history is never
# re-credited.
#
# WHAT AN OPERATOR MUST DO: run >= 9.4.0 (or set ANIMICA_FORK_TREASURY_25_HEIGHT)
# BEFORE height 70,000. A node still on 9.3.x computes a 15% treasury output at
# H and will reject the network's 25% coinbase — it diverges on the first
# post-activation block. That is the entire upgrade obligation, and it is why the
# activation height needs enough runway for miners and exchanges to take the
# release. Retunable via ANIMICA_FORK_TREASURY_25_HEIGHT if adoption slips.

# FORK_BOUNDED_RETARGET (9.5.0) — close a ONE-WAY TRAPDOOR in the difficulty
# retarget. Activation height 75,000.
#
# THE BUG, in the deployed code: `update_theta`'s emergency valve fires when a block
# interval exceeds max_block_time_s (mainnet 3600s) and returns
# `theta_micro = theta_min_micro` DIRECTLY — bypassing step_clamp_micro entirely. On
# live mainnet params that is theta 26,821,504 -> 12,000,000 µnats in a single block.
# theta is log-work, so per-block work falls by e^(26.82-12.00) ≈ 2.7 MILLION times at
# once.
#
# Then it cannot climb back. At the floor, blocks are produced as fast as the pool
# will emit them, but min_block_spacing_ms (60,000) pins dt at exactly the 60s target,
# so r_k = ln(dt/T) = ln(1) = 0. The error signal is identically zero, tau never rises,
# and theta stays on the floor FOREVER. One slow block permanently destroys the chain's
# work level — and with a single block producer (100% of recent blocks come from one
# coinbase) one stalled pool is all it takes.
#
# THE FIX, from H:
#   1. The emergency reduction is CLAMPED. It may fall by at most
#      EMERGENCY_STEP_MULTIPLE * step_clamp_micro per block instead of teleporting to
#      the floor, so a stall still recovers in a handful of blocks but cannot erase the
#      work level in one.
#   2. A FLOOR ESCAPE. When theta sits at/near theta_min and blocks are arriving no
#      slower than target, theta ratchets UP by the step clamp. "dt == target while
#      pinned at the floor" is evidence that the floor is too low, not evidence of
#      equilibrium — which is exactly the reading that made the trapdoor permanent.
#
# Both are gated on the height, forward-only and grandfathered: below H the function is
# byte-identical to today, so replaying history cannot change any theta. The rule is a
# pure function of (state, dt, height), so two honest nodes always agree.

# FORK_VALUE_CALL (9.5.0) — a CALL may carry ANM. Activation height 75,000.
#
# TxKind.CALL had no amount field at all, which is why Animica Pay cannot perform an
# atomic 98/2 merchant split (it settles accounting-exact instead) and why a valueless
# CALL can grief a payment: every contract that wants to be paid has to fake it.
#
# BELOW H a CALL carrying a non-zero amount is INVALID. That is today's behaviour by
# construction — the field could not be expressed — so history is untouched and no
# existing transaction changes meaning. FROM H the amount is debited from the caller and
# credited to the callee before execution, and returned by revert semantics.
#
# The encoding is backward-compatible BY OMISSION: TxCall.to_obj() emits "amount" only
# when non-zero, and to_obj() is the canonical form the signing preimage and txid are
# computed over. Emitting it unconditionally would have changed the bytes of every CALL
# ever signed.
#
# This is a CAPABILITY ADDITION, not a redistribution: nobody's revenue changes, so
# adoption pressure is low and the risk is contained to the execution path rather than
# emission. Retunable via ANIMICA_FORK_VALUE_CALL_HEIGHT.

# FORK_FINALITY_DEPTH (9.5.0) — make the reorg bound UNIFORM. Activation height 75,000.
#
# A depth bound already exists and is already enforced: DEFAULT_MAX_REORG_DEPTH = 96,
# checked in consensus.fork_choice.WeightForkChoice.add_block, which simply declines to
# make a tip canonical when the reorg would be deeper. What does NOT exist is agreement
# about the number — ANIMICA_MAX_REORG_DEPTH is an unbounded operator override, so today
# one node can be set to 0 (refuses EVERY reorg, and therefore strands itself on the
# next natural one-block fork — exactly the self-wedge that pinned checkpoints keep
# having to clean up) while another is set to 10^9 (accepts an arbitrarily deep reorg).
#
# From H the effective bound is CLAMPED into [MIN_REORG_DEPTH, FINALITY_DEPTH]:
#   * the ceiling gives the finality property — a block FINALITY_DEPTH deep is
#     irreversible on every node regardless of local configuration;
#   * the floor makes the self-wedge misconfiguration impossible.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated plainly because it is the reason it was requested: it
# would NOT have prevented the 28,167 / 38,728 / 44,854 wedges. Every one of those was
# a natural ONE-BLOCK fork (see the comments on PINNED_CHECKPOINTS_BY_NETWORK above), so
# a depth-96 guard never fired and a depth-100 guard never would. Those were caused by
# the headers pipeline discarding the winning sibling, not by a deep reorg. Finality is
# worth having on its own terms; it is not a fix for that outage class.
#
# It also never REJECTS a block — the guard only declines to make a tip canonical — so
# it cannot turn a node that is merely behind into a permanently split one. Retunable

# FORK_QUANTUM_BEACON (9.5.0) — the canonical chain MAY commit to attested
# quantum-sourced randomness. Activation height 75,000, and DORMANT BY DESIGN.
#
# PRESENCE-GATED, NEVER REQUIRED. A block that carries no beacon commitment is valid at
# every height, forever. Only a block that DOES commit one must commit a correct one.
# That is deliberate and it is the whole safety argument: a liveness dependency on
# beacon availability would mean a QRNG outage halts the chain, so there is no such
# dependency to fail open — there is simply nothing to be unavailable. The rule can sit
# activated and inert indefinitely, and is expected to.
#
# Same self-gating shape as FORK_STATE_COMMITMENT (a zero/uncommitted root is accepted,
# so a not-yet-upgraded miner never false-rejects), for the same reason.
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED when a commitment is present: the beacon value is recomputed as
# H(BEACON_DOMAIN || round || prev || aggregate_commitment) — the same construction as
# randomness.qrng.public.build_quantum_beacon — and the committed `prev` must equal the
# beacon value committed by the nearest ancestor that carried one. Recomputation makes it
# unforgeable from block bytes alone; the prev-chain is what makes the CANONICAL CHAIN,
# rather than an individual block, commit to the randomness.

# providers whether or not one claims it. Activation height 75,000.
#
# This is the only rule in the 9.5.0 set that changes WHO GETS PAID, so it is the one to
# suspect first if balances look wrong after activation. The others at this height
# (bounded retarget, value CALL, finality, beacon) cannot move a coin.
#
# It is emission-CONSERVING: the miner loses exactly the carve, and paid + residual
# equals the carve, so nothing is minted or burned. See consensus/rewards.py
# service_carve_pct for why it cannot instead be keyed on "did this miner serve"
# (nothing in a block can prove that), and consensus/service_carve.py for the split.
#
# NOTE ON THE FAILURE MODE, which is unusual: coinbase AMOUNTS are never validated
# against the schedule (`_compute_block_reward_amount` has zero callers), yet state
# application credits balances from the node's OWN compute_block_reward. So an
# un-upgraded node does not fork or stall — it accepts identical blocks and credits
# different balances, silently and permanently. Liveness is safe; the ledger is not.
# Every full node, pool and balance-tracker must be on >=9.5.0 before H.

#
# Before H, a CALL to a deployed contract deterministically REVERTs (charging only
# intrinsic gas) — which is exactly today's behaviour, because the metered VM was
# never wired: every historical CALL reverted. That makes activation history-safe
# by construction: no past block changes meaning, because below H the outcome is
# byte-identical to what it has always been (REVERT).
#
# FROM H, a CALL is executed by the deterministic, gas-metered tree interpreter
# (vm_py.runtime.tree_engine) against a compiled-and-cached IR of the contract's
# source, with storage and treasury bound to chain state. The interpreter is a
# closed sandbox — no import/exec/eval/attribute escape — so arbitrary deployed
# code can at worst revert, burn gas (→ OOG), or touch its OWN namespaced storage;
# it can neither run host code nor read another contract's state. Contract DEPLOY
# is unchanged (it only stores code and has always succeeded).
#
# This is the enabler for the on-chain token launcher + DEX (the standard
# animica_token / animica_dex_* contracts). It is a STATE-MUTATING change: from H,
# calls that used to revert now succeed and move balances/storage, so every full
# node, pool and balance-tracking explorer/exchange MUST run >= 9.6.0 (or set
# ANIMICA_FORK_VM_EXEC_HEIGHT) before H, or it will compute a divergent state root.

# settlement == the pre-fork miner output; never minted above the subsidy).
#
# MECHANISM (9.0.0, consensus/iou_settlement.py): a "settlement anchor" is an
# ordinary signed TRANSFER from the code-committed settlement authority (the
# foundation treasury account) carrying ANMSETL1 + a strict JSON distribution
# in TxTransfer.data. A block containing valid anchors pays the anchored
# entries in THAT block (cap-scaled). Pre-9.0.0 nodes accept the anchor tx as
# a plain transfer, so inclusion itself never splits the chain.
#
# SAFETY — the Sybil/inflation surface of the 8.0.1 design is closed by
# construction: consensus never measures off-chain contribution; it only
# rate-limits (cap) and executes distributions signed by the code-committed
# authority, which is settling ITS OWN off-chain IOU liabilities. SELF-GATING:
# with no anchors posted, behaviour at/after H is byte-identical to 8.0.x, so
# the operator arms settlement only after network adoption (the first anchor
# is the activation switch, exactly like FORK_STATE_COMMITMENT's sealed roots).
# Forward-only; grandfathered below H. NON-UPGRADED nodes credit the full
# subsidy to the miner once anchors flow — operators MUST run >= 9.0.0 before
# the first anchor posts. Retunable via ANIMICA_FORK_VPN_RELAY_REWARDS_HEIGHT.
