/*
 * Animica network-upgrade notice bar.
 * Central, self-contained, cross-origin-includable. One
 *   <script defer src="https://animica.dev/anm-upgrade-banner.js"></script>
 * on any site renders a fixed bottom notice. To retire it everywhere after the
 * upgrade, empty this file — no per-site change needed.
 *
 * Height-gated facts, verified against deployed core.network_params /
 * execution.migrations / consensus.rewards:
 *   block 44,444 — 7.1.9 consensus activation (treasury-scam clawback, a
 *     STATE-MUTATING migration + address freeze). A node not on >=7.1.9 keeps
 *     the scam accounts funded and SILENTLY DIVERGES from network balances.
 *   animica 7.2.0 (current release, supersedes 7.1.9 — contains everything in
 *     it) additionally fixes the 38,728 fork-wedge: nodes that took the losing
 *     side of the 2026-07-07 one-block fork sat stuck at height 38,728 forever;
 *     7.2.0 self-heals them at restart (pinned canonical checkpoint + sync
 *     fork-sibling ingest) and repairs snapshot bootstrap.
 * DEADLINE is 70,000 again — a REAL mandatory activation, so the CTA is the upgrade
 *   guide and the pre-activation branch carries the countdown. NOTE the branches:
 *   height < DEADLINE renders the PRE branch, and it had been left carrying the
 *   retired 50,000 IOU copy while the new text sat in the post-activation branch
 *   nobody would see until it was already too late. Check which branch renders at
 *   the current height before shipping banner copy.
 * Current release: animica 9.7.0. CONSENSUS FLOOR IS 9.7.0 — VERSION and CONSENSUS_MIN
 *   are the same number here because 9.7.0 is the release that WIRED the 75,000 forks.
 *   They were defined-but-dead in network_params before it (the node computed the old
 *   split and reverted the new rules), so every earlier node is non-compliant at 75,000.
 * ONE MANDATORY CONSENSUS HEIGHT, 75,000. FORK_TREASURY_25 was once slated for 70,000 but
 *   the reward code never read the flag there, so nothing activated and no realized history
 *   changed; 9.7.0 moves it to 75,000 so the whole reward-split change lands in one step.
 *   75,000 — the split becomes 50% miner / 25% treasury / 25% inference:
 *     FORK_TREASURY_25 raises the treasury 15% -> 25%, and FORK_SERVICE_CARVE reserves
 *     25% of every block for inference, WITHHELD FROM THE MINER whether or not anything
 *     claims it (miner 85% -> 50%). Unclaimed inference rolls to the foundation treasury
 *     (escrow == treasury in the wiring), so a no-claim block is 50/50 and any unclaimed
 *     remainder on a partly-claimed block also goes to the treasury.
 *     Also at 75,000: on-chain contract execution (FORK_VM_EXEC — the token launcher +
 *     DEX), value-carrying CALL, bounded difficulty retarget, uniform reorg bound, and
 *     quantum-beacon binding (optional/dormant by design). All were unwired before 9.7.0.
 *   COUNTDOWN: mount() counts to the NEXT pending height, not always DEADLINE — a
 *     countdown to 75,000 while 70,000 is still ahead understates urgency by ~2,000 blocks.
 *   BANNER SELF-CHECK: this file once carried a stray copy fragment ABOVE the IIFE that
 *     referenced `count`, so the whole script threw ReferenceError on load and NO banner
 *     rendered on any site for a while. `node --check` passes on that file — it is
 *     syntactically fine. Always EXECUTE it against a fake DOM before shipping.
 * Superseded headline: animica 9.4.0 — MANDATORY CONSENSUS UPGRADE at block 70,000.
 *   FORK_TREASURY_25: the foundation-treasury share of every block subsidy goes from
 *   15% to 25% (miner 85% -> 75%). The subsidy TOTAL and the halving schedule are
 *   unchanged, so emission and MAX_MONEY are untouched — only the division changes.
 *   HOW AN UN-UPGRADED NODE FAILS — corrected 2026-08-09, the first description was
 *   wrong. There is NO rejection and NO fork. `_compute_block_reward_amount`
 *   (block_import.py:702) has ZERO callers and the only coinbase validation
 *   (_validate_coinbase_outputs_nonzero, :386) checks solely for a zero-address
 *   output — coinbase AMOUNTS are never checked against compute_block_reward. But
 *   state application credits balances from the node's OWN compute_block_reward
 *   (block_import.py:~2796 reward_outputs), not from the block's coinbase tx. So a
 *   9.3.x node accepts byte-identical blocks and credits a 15% treasury forever:
 *   a SILENT, PERMANENT ledger divergence with no orphan, no stall and no error.
 *   That is quieter than a fork and therefore more dangerous for anyone reading
 *   balances. Every full node, pool and balance-tracking exchange must run >=9.4.0
 *   (or set ANIMICA_FORK_TREASURY_25_HEIGHT) BEFORE 70,000.
 * Previous headline: animica 9.3.2 — THE CLI IS AN AGENTIC CODING ASSISTANT (non-consensus).
 *   `animica chat` reads, edits and runs code in the directory you start it in, with four
 *   approval modes, parallel /swarm agents, piped stdin, and AGENTS.md support. It needs no API
 *   key, no wallet and no GPU: inference is kimi-k3 served by the miner network. Free tier is
 *   unlimited chat + 10 agentic tasks/day; paid plans lift the caps (animica.dev/#pricing).
 *   Nothing here is consensus-affecting, so no node MUST take it — but it SUPERSEDES 9.2.0 and
 *   carries every fix below, so `pip install -U animica` is still the right command for a miner
 *   who wants per-share payouts. Previous headline:
 * animica 9.2.0 — SUB-BLOCK SHARES (re-enabled; all review findings closed) (non-consensus; miners + pool operators).
 *   The wire share target is a RATIO of θ and the xmrig-compat floor pinned it at 1.0 == θ == the
 *   block target, so a "share" WAS a block and PPS paid only block finders. 9.1.0 hands sub-block
 *   (9.1.1: every shipped miner opts in automatically + `animica up` reports it) targets to sessions that opt in on mining.subscribe (features.subblockShares) — derived per job
 *   as r = 1 - MICRO*ln(S)/θ so a share is worth 1/S of a block and the pool-wide share rate is
 *   S/block_time. Every client that does NOT opt in (xmrig, ASIC, cryptonote, older miners) keeps
 *   byte-for-byte the target it got before. Carries 9.0.9/9.0.10: 5% block-reserve so credit-cap
 *   headroom is never fully drained by the winner, per-IP stratum connection cap + idle-session
 *   reaper (one client held 835 idle sockets => "838 miners"), honest num_miners vs num_connections,
 *   and a defensive miner-side set_difficulty parser (an unparseable push used to kill the miner).
 * Previous: animica 9.0.8/9.0.6 — RPC unbounded-scan fix (node stall), see git history.
 *   rpc/methods/tx.py + receipt.py fell back to an UNBOUNDED linear block scan (4096 deep)
 *   whenever the tx/receipt index missed — i.e. for any pending/unknown txid, exactly what
 *   status pollers ask about. ~4.4ms/block => ~18s of SQLite-lock-holding CPU per miss; a few
 *   pollers occupied every RPC worker thread and starved miner.getBlockTemplate, so the pool
 *   could not build jobs and BLOCK PRODUCTION STALLED (mainnet froze at 54262 for ~57min).
 *   9.0.6 bounds both scans to 128 (env-overridable). getBlockTemplate 20s -> 29ms.
 *   Carries 9.0.5 (mining sync-gate: a peer's false height can no longer halt production),
 *   9.0.4 (p2p dial/handshake timeouts) and the 9.0.1 LTS line.
 *   No genesis reset / no state change — safe-for-all; hosted-service & wallet users need do nothing.
 * Pre-activation: mandatory-upgrade bar (7.1.9 campaign @ 44,444). Post-activation
 * (height >= 44,444, the case today): the 44,854 stuck-node remedy notice, until
 * RETIRE_STUCK.
 * Balance-tracking exchanges/explorers and pools/miners MUST be on >=7.1.9
 * before 44,444 — install 7.2.0. Ordinary users of hosted services and
 * wallets need do nothing — the copy says so, so they self-select out.
