Deploy & Preflight Routers

Endpoints:
  - POST /deploy     : accept a signed CBOR tx and relay via node RPC
  - POST /preflight  : simulate a deploy/call locally (no state writes)

These endpoints are thin shims over the service layer in
`studio_services.services.deploy`. They purposefully avoid embedding business
logic; errors are raised as ApiError (mapped by middleware).
