"""Adversarial regression suite for FORK_USEFUL_WORK_VERIFY.

Every test here started life as a working proof-of-concept attack against the
first revision of ``consensus/useful_work_verify.py`` +
``core/chain/block_import._ImporterChainView``. They are kept as tests so the
attacks cannot come back, and — for the one attack that CANNOT be fixed in this
design — so nobody mistakes the rule for something it is not.

Two categories, and the difference matters:

  FIXED   — the attack is now rejected. The test asserts the rejection AND, where
            it is cheap, asserts that the pre-fix path is genuinely gone.
  PINNED  — the attack still works and always will in this shape. The test
            asserts the ATTACK SUCCEEDS, so that a future reader who believes
            "the receipt binding forces real inference" is contradicted by a
            green test rather than by a paragraph of prose.

Attack inventory:

  1. FORGERY (PINNED)   a miner running a null worker signs a receipt for work it
                        never did. Passes every check, by design: check 2
                        REQUIRES worker == coinbase, so the signer is always the
                        miner.
  2. ZERO-COST PAYMENT (FIXED)  a TRANSFER that reverts for insufficient balance
                        is included in a block, indexed, and moved nothing and
                        paid no fee — yet satisfied "the requester paid 1 ANM".
  3. ORPHAN SPLIT (FIXED)  a node that saw an orphan burned the receipt's
                        nullifier in memory and then rejected the canonical block
                        that re-used it, while a node that never saw the orphan
                        accepted. Two honest nodes, permanent partition.
  4. ORPHAN PAYMENT (FIXED)  the global tx index is never pruned on reorg, so a
                        payment that exists only on a detached branch funded a
                        proof on the canonical chain.
  5. RESTART DIVERGENCE (FIXED)  the nullifier store was in-memory, so a
                        restarted node re-accepted what a long-uptime node
                        rejected.
  6. BUILD SPLIT (FIXED)  a node missing the vendored PQ backend rejected every
                        proof with a reason indistinguishable from a bad
                        signature.
