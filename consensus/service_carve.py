"""FORK_SERVICE_CARVE (9.5.0) — split the reserved service slice, deterministically.

The rule in one line: from the activation height the miner subsidy loses a fixed
percentage whether or not any service provider claims it, and settlement anchors decide
only whether that slice reaches providers or the treasury — all of it, either way.

Why not "pay miners who serve": nothing in a block can prove a miner served inference.
There is no on-chain worker keyring, no job ids, no result hashes, and `header.extra` is
miner-authored — a stub box with no ML stack could sign "I served 100 jobs" and no
validator could contradict it. A rule that pays on self-attestation pays everyone who
edits a config value, out of the honest miners' subsidy. So the chain never measures
serving; it only declines to hand the service slice to the block producer.

The arithmetic lives here, apart from block_import, because it is the part that must be
provably emission-conserving and is worth reading on its own:

    carve    = floor(TOTAL_subsidy * pct / 100)     <- the TOTAL, not the miner remainder
    paid     = sum of anchor outputs, each clamped so paid never exceeds carve
    residual = carve - paid                          (>= 0 by construction)
    miner    = miner_reward - carve                  (NOT - paid: that is the rule)

so paid + residual == carve exactly, and miner + carve == the pre-carve miner slice.
Nothing is minted, nothing is burned, and there is no floating point anywhere.

WHERE THE CARVE GOES is decided by ONE question — did any provider claim in this block?

  * NO inference claimed (paid == 0) — nobody is owed anything, so the slice is operator
    revenue and goes to the FOUNDATION TREASURY. This is the common case today.
  * ANY inference claimed (paid > 0) — the WHOLE slice is paid to the claiming providers,
    pro-rata by claim size. Nothing is held back and nothing falls to the treasury.

That second rule is deliberate (10.2.5): the carve is inference money, so once a block
has a provider in it the treasury takes no part of it. It replaces an earlier middle case
where a partial claim sent the remainder to a "service escrow" — which resolves to the
treasury address anyway, making it indistinguishable from revenue on-chain, and leaving
providers paid less than the block reserved for them.

The practical consequence, stated plainly because it is large: a provider anchored for a
small claim receives the whole carve of that block, not the claim. Claim SIZE therefore
sets the pro-rata split BETWEEN providers, not the total they receive. The settlement
authority decides who appears in an anchor, so it — not this function — is what bounds
payouts to what was actually earned.

THE BASE MATTERS. The carve is 25% OF THE BLOCK, so it is measured against the
reconstructed pre-split subsidy (miner + treasury + aicf), not against the post-treasury
miner slice — 25% of 75% would be 18.75% of the block. With the treasury already taking
25%, the resulting split is exactly miner 50% / treasury 25% / inference 25%.
