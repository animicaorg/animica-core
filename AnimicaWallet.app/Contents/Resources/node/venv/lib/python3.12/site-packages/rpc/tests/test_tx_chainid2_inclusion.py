"""
Integration test for transaction inclusion on chainId=2 (testnet).

This test verifies that:
1. Transactions with chainId=2 are properly decoded and validated
2. Full transaction fields (from/to/value/gas/maxFee/nonce/chainId) are populated in pending tx views
3. Transactions are included in mined blocks with non-zero txsRoot
4. State is properly updated (nonce increments, balances change)
