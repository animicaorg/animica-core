"""
Test that mining paths use real difficulty/targets, not trivial shortcuts.

This test validates that production mining code:
1. Uses real difficulty values from consensus, not hardcoded trivial values
2. Properly converts µ-nats thresholds to 256-bit targets
3. Does not fall back to instant/minimum difficulty shortcuts
4. Stratum server respects share targets derived from consensus Θ

These tests ensure mock/stub implementations are isolated to test code only.
