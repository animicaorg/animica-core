"""
Animica P2P — Gossip subsystem
==============================

Public surface for the gossip layer. This package implements a lightweight,
GossipSub-like pub/sub with topic IDs, validator hooks, and a mesh manager.

Modules
-------
- topics.py      : canonical topics and helpers
- validator.py   : per-topic validators (fast sanity before decode)
- mesh.py        : mesh maintenance (fanout / graft / prune)
- engine.py      : high-level publish/subscribe engine

This __init__ file re-exports the primary types for convenience.
