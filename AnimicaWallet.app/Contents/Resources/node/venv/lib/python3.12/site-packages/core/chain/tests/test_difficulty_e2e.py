"""
End-to-end integration test for difficulty adjustment.

Simulates a realistic scenario with:
- Genesis block
- Initial stable block production
- Hash rate increase (faster blocks)
- Hash rate decrease (slower blocks)
- Return to equilibrium

Validates that difficulty adjusts appropriately to maintain target block time.
