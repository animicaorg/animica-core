"""
Execution ⇄ Randomness adapter (read-only, contract-facing).

This module exposes a deterministic *beacon read* surface that contracts (via
the VM/runtime bindings) can use to access the chain's randomness beacon.

Design goals
------------
- Read-only and deterministic: given a block height (and optional lookback),
  returns the exact 32-byte beacon digest that every honest node will derive.
- No heavy objects: we return the canonical 32-byte digest (sha3-256 over the
  BeaconOut encoding) rather than large records.
- Domain separation helpers: convenience to derive per-contract pseudo-random
  bytes from the beacon digest using SHAKE-256, with explicit labels.

Data source
-----------
We read pointers stored by `randomness.adapters.core_db.RandomnessCoreDB`
during block sealing. Those pointers include the `beacon_digest` and `round_id`
for each block height.

Typical usage (VM / syscall binding)
------------------------------------
    # In a binding layer with access to the current block height:
    from randomness.adapters.core_db import RandomnessCoreDB
    from randomness.adapters.execution import ExecutionRandomness

    exec_rand = ExecutionRandomness(pointer_source=RandomnessCoreDB(kv))
    digest32 = exec_rand.beacon_digest_at_height(block_height)
    # Or derive N bytes for contract-specific randomness:
    rnd = exec_rand.derive_bytes(block_height, label=b"myContract.op:42", nbytes=64)

Errors
------
- NoBeaconAvailable: no pointer exists at the target height (or its beacon_digest is None)
- ValueError: invalid arguments (negative lookback, height underflow, etc.)
