Test transaction receipt persistence and retrieval.

Tests that:
1. Receipts are persisted when blocks are mined
2. Receipts can be retrieved via tx.getReceipt and tx.getTransactionReceipt
3. Receipt contains correct status, gasUsed, block info
4. Pending transactions return null for receipt lookup
