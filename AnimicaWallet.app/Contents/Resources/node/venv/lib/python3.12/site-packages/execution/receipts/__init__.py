"""
execution.receipts — helpers for building, encoding, and hashing receipt data.

This package centralizes:
  • builder:    ApplyResult → Receipt construction
  • encoding:   Deterministic CBOR encode/decode for receipts
  • logs_hash:  Logs bloom and logs Merkle/root helpers

Import convenience
------------------
Common helpers are re-exported here for ergonomic imports:

    from execution.receipts import build_receipt
    from execution.receipts import receipt_to_cbor, receipt_from_cbor
    from execution.receipts import compute_logs_bloom, compute_logs_root
