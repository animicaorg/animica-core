"""
Animica • Data Availability • CLI
=================================

Package marker for DA command-line utilities.

This namespace will host small, focused CLIs such as:
- put_blob.py    : Post a blob; print commitment & receipt.
- get_blob.py    : Retrieve a blob by commitment (to stdout or file).
- sim_sample.py  : Simulate DAS sampling and report p_fail.
- inspect_root.py: Decode/inspect an NMT root and namespace ranges.
- provider.py    : Storage provider management commands.
- serve.py       : Start provider service daemon.

Each CLI is designed to be importable as a module (for programmatic use)
and runnable as a script (e.g., `python -m da.cli.put_blob`).
